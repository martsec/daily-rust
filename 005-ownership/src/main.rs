    One for simple and usually compile-time known variables (stored in the stack)
    And the other one more complex classes like Vec and String, that usually vary in lenght.

    The fists one goes to the stack and it's usually copied, while the latter goes to the heap.
    For those variables we usually hold a *UNIQUE* reference in the stack. 
    This uniquenes is where the *ownership* concept comes from. Due to how memory is managed,
    if two variables could have the same reference, we could end up cleaning it twice or something
    worse, causing fragility and potential security threads.
