= Data Tools in Rust

Quick comparison of the main data tools in rust. 


== UseCase

Aircrafts historical data from adsb_exchange. 

* Extract from raw files and store as table format (parquet and native if supported)
* Analyze the parquet files to obtain aircraft statistics
* [Real time] Time individual aircraft statistics retrieval

It provides a couple challenges that can help us analyze real use cases:  

. Explode 1000s of nested JSONs 
. Several GB of data
. Compaction to a more manageable number of files


This will affect memory usage, since some tools have issues concatenating files.


== Libaries compared 

* duckDB
* polars 
* Data Fusion (Arrow)

== Enhancements

* Analyze iceberg support
