_In the context of the Web shop service,_
_facing the need to keep user session data consistent and current across shop instances,_

[%hardbreaks]
_we decided for the Database Session State pattern_
_and against Client Session State or Server Session State_

[%hardbreaks]
_to achieve data consistency and cloud elasticity,_
_accepting that a session database needs to be designed and implemented._

Each template element appears on one line in the above example:

1. context: functional requirement (story, use case) or arch. component,
2. facing: non-functional requirement, for instance a desired quality,
3. we decided: decision outcome (arguably the most important part),
4. and neglected alternatives not chosen (not to be forgotten!),
5. to achieve: benefits, the full or partial satisfaction of requirement(s),
6. accepting that: drawbacks and other consequences, for instance impact on other properties/context and effort/cost (both short term and long term).

In the context of the plai game website,
facing the need of uniquelly identify lobbies and players, 

[%hardbreaks]
we decided for the uuid::v7 
and against numerical and uuid::v4 ids

[%hardbreaks]
to achieve uniqueness in a distributed environment and database optimization,
accepting that might not be the most space-efficient identifier nor the most 
random.
