showcase-intro = Draw the cards to find their real-life inspiration.
showcase-seen = 
    {$cardsCount ->
      [zero] No cards seen yet
      [one] Congrats! You've seen your first card
      *[other] You've seen {$cardsCount} cards out of {$total}
    }.

showcase-dotcom = Dot-com crash
    .description = 
        This card is inspired in the dot-com bubble, 
        a hyper-hype cycle of the market where it 
        was almost impossible to not jump into it.

showcase-select-employees = Select Employees
    .description = 
        Several startups and corporations anounced AI to help companies with hiring. 
        They will find the best candidates from thousands of CVs. 
        So you can eliminate human bias from your process.
    .challenge = 
        Sounds great, doesn't it? The challenge though, is how those algoritms
        learn. 
        They use historical data, where white males were in positions of power. 
        So AI did as it learned: discarded women, darker skins and 
        people coming from public universities. 

showcase-daily = Daily standup
    .description = 
        Ah, the paladin of the mighty developer enemy. 
        
        Legendary is its duration and micromanagement power. 
        
        The lonely coder tries to cope with blockers, bugs, tickets
        and lack of memory.
    .punchline=
        And don't forget his henchmen, who accompany him on his morning ride:
        jira, kanban and large scale scrum.

showcase-more-data = Hungry for your data
    .description = Imagine a never-ending hunger. 
        You are not the only one to suffer it, but you have a secret stash. 
    .challenge = 
        It's typical to say that when you don't pay for the product, 
        you are the product. Nowadays though, you are the product no matter 
        if you pay or not. All companies neeeeeed the fuel you give them. 
        It's the new oil!

showcase-antitrust = You are too big, and you will change this sentence
    .description = 
        Free markets are the theoretical king of our current economical system.
        And it has been demonstrated that company concentration is not good for 
        the general economy nor the consumers. 
        If there is just one big player, it just raises the prices for everyone!
    .challenge = Sadly, this card is more of a wish than a reality. 
        Companies continue to grow more and more. 
        And once a regulatory body acts, they just use their power to 
        give money away to previous members of those insitutions. 
        Just to do... normal things, you know? 
showcase-winart = Stealing your content
    .description= 
        GenAI is the shiny buzzword. 
        Every CEO needs it like a daily shower. 
        So watch out artitst because they are here for you. 
        Your talent, innovation, experience and ideas will be encoded in the machine, 
        so your unique style is now replicated by anyone that can write two sentences.
    .challenge = 
        To avoid this, several projects have appeared to protect art creations
        from this type of "inspiration". One of them is Glaze from the University 
        of Chicago, it will cloak your creations to make them invisible to AI while remaining
        as beautiful as expected to human eyes.
